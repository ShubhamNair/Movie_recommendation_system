# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project develops a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, this project offers insights into the general sentiment of the public towards films based on their reviews.

## Files Description
- `nlp_model.pkl`: A pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model used for classifying reviews.
- `preprocessing_1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing initial preprocessing steps on movie data, such as text normalization and tokenization.
- `preprocessing_2.ipynb`: Continuation of data preprocessing, focusing on text cleaning and preparation for model training.
- `preprocessing_3.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating additional preprocessing steps and merging of different data sources.
- `preprocessing_4.ipynb`: Final preprocessing steps, particularly for data from the year 2020, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- `sentiment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that outlines the creation, training, and evaluation of the sentiment analysis model.

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing notebooks (`preprocessing_1.ipynb` to `preprocessing_4.ipynb`) to prepare the data.
2. Execute `sentiment.ipynb` to train the sentiment analysis model and evaluate its performance.
3. Use the trained model (`nlp_model.pkl`) for your sentiment analysis tasks on movie reviews.

## Requirements
Python 3 and the following libraries are required: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK.
